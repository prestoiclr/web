                    Despite advances in diffusion-based text-to-music (TTM) methods, efficient, high-quality generation remains a challenge. 
                    We introduce Presto!, an approach to inference acceleration for score-based diffusion transformers via reducing both sampling steps and cost per step. 
                    To reduce steps, we develop a new score-based distribution matching distillation (DMD) method for the EDM-family of diffusion models, the first GAN-based distillation method for TTM. 
                    To reduce the cost per step, we develop a simple, but powerful improvement to a recent layer distillation method that improves learning via preserving hidden state variance. 
                    Finally, we combine our improved step and layer distillation methods together for a dual-faceted approach.
                    We evaluate our step and layer distillation methods independently and show each yield best-in-class performance. 
                    Furthermore, we find our combined distillation method can generate high-quality outputs with improved diversity accelerating our base model by 10-18x (32 second output in 230ms, 15x faster than the comparable SOTA model)
                    --- the fastest TTM model to our knowledge.
